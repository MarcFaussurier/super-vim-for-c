This is a merge of TheVimIDE (https://github.com/Shadowsith/TheVimIDE),
ThinkVIM (https://github.com/hardcoreplayers/ThinkVim), and Vim-42Header
(https://github.com/pbondoer/vim-42header).

-----

# Introduction

The goal of this repo is allow myself to quickly rollback if I accidentally 
somehow destroy my installation. 

- 42 Header will install on your VIM (~.vim/after/plugin, press f1 in vim)

- TheVimIDE will install on your VIM (everything you need for C).

- Your NEOVIM will use your VIM (everything you need for C one again)

- ThinkVIM will install on NVIM 
autocompletion features are removed in favor of TheVimIDE ThinkVIM is mostly 
here for NVIM colors both in files and terminal.

- *I SUGGEST YOU TO INSTALL VimR FOR AWESOME EXPERIENCE*
