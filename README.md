# Introduction

The goal of this repo is allow myself to quickly rollback if I accidentally 
somehow destroy my installation. 

- 42 Header will install on your VIM (~.vim/after/plugin, press f1 in vim)

- TheVimIDE will install on your VIM (everything you need for C).

- Your NEOVIM will use your VIM (everything you need for C one again)

- ThinkVIM will install on NVIM, also 
autocompletion features are removed in favor of TheVimIDE. ThinkVIM is mostly 
here for NVIM colors both in files and terminal.

- *I SUGGEST YOU TO INSTALL VimR FOR AWESOME EXPERIENCE* 
http://vimr.org

# Features

- Awesome colors, tagbars and such visuals, enjoy even colors in NVIM :terminal
[ThinkVIM] 

- Awesome C completion in VIM and NVIM [TheVimIDE]
